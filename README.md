# UXP Indesign React Typescript Starter

A starter template with webpack configured for creating Indesign Plugins with UXP.

To run:

1. `npm i`
2. `npm run build`
3. `npm run watch`
4. Load the plugin manifest located in the /dist folder in UXP Developer Tools
5. Watch the loaded plugin from the "Watch" button in UXP Developer Tools
6. Every time you save source code, webpack will hot-load and UXP Dev Tools will detect changes and reload

Remember! If you change the manifest, you have to reload the plugin
